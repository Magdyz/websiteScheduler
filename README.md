Website scheduler script

A lot of websites these days ask you to wait in a queue starting certain times. The purpose of this script is to make sure you are the first or at least as early as possible to open the website. 

There are two options at the moment you could call the function setTime() this will open one website in a new window automatically on certain date and time that one inputs

The script asks for the time and date and name of the website that needs to opened on a certain time to be ahead of the queue.

All inputs are sanitised to be numbers and text when needed.

Thanks,
