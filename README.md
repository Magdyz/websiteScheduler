# Website Scheduler
Website scheduler 

A lot of websites these days ask you to wait in a queue starting certain times. The purpose of this script is to make sure you are the first or at least as early as possible to open the website. 

There are two options at the moment open one website in a new window automatically or five tabs of the same website with some small time interval.

The script asks for the time and date and name of the website that needs to opened on a certain time to be ahead of the queue.

All inputs are sanitised to be numbers and text when needed.

Two options are available. For example:

1- Open a website that starts a queue exactly at 10 am automatically and be ahead of the queue.

2- Open five tabs starting 9:59 AM in order to make sure you get in the queue ahead of anyone else.
